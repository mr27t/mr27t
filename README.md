# mr27t Im new to all of this so please be kind. 
interested in 3d printing and would like to build my own (diy).
my idea is to use Reprap Ramps 1.4 Kit with Mega 2560 r3
+ Heatbed MK2B + 12864 LCD Controller + DRV8825 +Mechanical Switch +Cables for 3D Printer
i have no experience with such an undertaking.
i have reviewed many youtube videos and like the anet a6 very much.
purchasing the anet a6 would make life easier.
i want to learn 3d printing and to know my printer from the inside out. 
in the batman series, the joker has batman down and out, an easy kill.
the joker could have easily eliminated the batman, yet he does not.
why.
answer: it is to simple
batman would not learn nothin
